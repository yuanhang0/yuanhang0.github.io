## About Me

Welcome to my website, a space where I share my thoughts on intriguing problems I've encountered or discussed with friends.

## A Little Bit About Me

I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics, a Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. My diverse educational background stems from a deep curiosity that led me to explore a wide range of subjects during my college years.

Currently, I work as a data scientist in the US, specializing in commercial data analytics. In my role, I have developed innovative advanced analytics models to support various brands and new product launches. My work includes designing experiments and conducting causal inference analyses to measure the impact of marketing on sales, which helps inform data-driven decisions about marketing execution and spending. 

I aim to keep this website updated with new content, though not on a regular schedule. I hope you find the posts enjoyable and thought-provoking!
