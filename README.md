## About Me

This website is intended to share my thoughts on some small but interesting problems I encountered and/or discussed with my friends.

A little bit about me: I have a Ph.D. degree in Statistics, a Master's and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. This very unique education background originated from my curiosity, which drove my to take many classes in college.

Currently I'm working as a data scientist with a focus on commerical data analytics in the US.

I will keep updating this website but not on a regular basis. I hope you enjoy it!
